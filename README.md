## Problem statement:
Our task is to build a Timeline component.  When we're finished, it should look similar to the following simplified version of a timeline

![Example One](/example.png "Optional Title")


## Background: 
Within the ClearMetal application, the simplest way to understand the status of your shipment is to view it in it's timeline form.  
Whether you're viewing a Booking, a Purchase Order, or something else, this view is essential to getting a "quick view" of your shipment.  

Here's what a timeline like in our application
![Example One](/screen_shot.png "Optional Title")



## Requirements:
* Elements within the timeline should be evenly spaced apart
* Each element should have a circular icon above it
* An element should be centered below the circular icon
* A developer should be able to easily specify the color of the icon

## What we are measuring:
* Your ability to discuss and design your implementation
* Your ability to create a component that is easy to work with from a developers perspective
* The simplicity and cleanliness of your code
