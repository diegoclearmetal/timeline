Background: Within the ClearMetal application, the simplest way to understand the status of your shipment is to view it in it's timeline form.  
Whether you're viewing a Booking, a Purchase Order, or something else, this view is essential to getting a "quick view" of your shipment.  

Our task is to build this Timeline component.  When we're finished, it should look similar to the following simplified version of a timeline

Requirements:
* Elements within the timeline should be evenly spaced apart
* Each element should have a circular icon above it
* An element should be centered below the circular icon
* A developer should be able to easily specify the color of the icon

What we are measuring:
* Your ability to discuss and design your implementation
* Your ability to create a component that is easy to work with from a developers perspective
* The simplicity and cleanliness of your code
